Marvel Website made with HTML and Bootstrap CSS

For my class we had to create different images and show that we could create a digital website with HTML and CSS. We created our own images in the simplest way we could and each one of us individually coded our own websites with tags and links. Although the images aren't great, the main point of this assignment was to learn to create websites with tags, headlines, links and many other features. Later on we used WordPress to edit the website and AWS for hosting.
